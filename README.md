Some of these projects were created by Youtuber Brian Voong, also known as LetsBuildThatApp. I'm taking some of his courses to better my iOS and Swift programming skills.
If you're interested in his courses, you should checkout his youtube channel at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA or website www.letsbuildthatapp.com.
