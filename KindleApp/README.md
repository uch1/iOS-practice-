The goal for this tutorial was to build an Amazon Kindle App clone. In the tutorial series, I learned how to apply autolayout programmatically and build UI elements from scratch without the storyboard. These video tutorials were very clear and straigthforward, and Brian Voong clarified the reasons why building your projects in code provides you with a better learning experience of how UIKIT works.
